# Ethical Stealer Proof of Concept - Loud Project

Welcome to the "Loud Project" repository, where we showcase a proof of concept for an ethical stealer with FUD (Fully Undetectable) capabilities, specifically designed to bypass Chrome's latest cookie encryption. This project is created using Bun for stealth (0% detection rate) and packaged with pkg to achieve a low detection rate of 2%. It is essential to note that this project is for educational purposes only. 

## üöÄ Features

- Advanced token logging and stealing capabilities
- Built with BunJS for obfuscation and stealth
- Bypass antivirus detection for improved security
- GUI (Graphical User Interface) created with Electron Builder for user-friendly interaction
- Supports tokens for various platforms such as Discord and other services
